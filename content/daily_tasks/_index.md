Building a new "you" can seem like a daunting task. Likely, you've tried before and failed. Why will this time be different?

For starters, you didn't fail previously. You found some ways that don't work. By eliminating what doesn't work, you get 
closer to finding what does. In this challenge, we're breaking things down Mickey Mouse style. It's not because I think 
you're dumb. It's because we all have a lot going on and taking on too much too soon leads to failure. 

So we break it down into little steps.

Little steps are easier to complete.

Completing multiple little steps compels you to keep going.

For 45 days, you will have some tasks to complete each day. This chapter explains what those tasks are and why they are included in 
this challenge. In case it's not clear, you should read this chapter _before_ starting the challenge.
