It seems pretty straightforward, right? Drink 1 gallon of water. After all, it's still 100 degrees outside, how hard can this be?

You might be surprised.

## Why drinking water is important

Sixty percent of your body is water. Your body uses water to
* regulate body temperature
* carry nutrients and oxygen to your cells
* protect vital organs and tissues
* joint lubrication
* keep tissues in your eyes, mouth, and nose healthy and moist

There have also been studies showing that many people mistake thirst for hunger, which can lead to overeating. So water is good stuff.

## How much water do you need?

Many factors influence how much water your body needs. Your activity level, the temperature, and even the food types can impact how much your body needs. Because of the varying factors, there is little scientific evidence to say how much is enough. One gallon per day is enough to cover all but the extreme cases.

## Why is this part of the challenge?

Drinking 1 gallon of water is in the challenge for two reasons:
1. Your body needs the water, and you likely aren't drinking enough
2. Sometimes, the simplest tasks are the hardest. If it's 11 pm and you still have 1 quart of water in your jug, guess who will be up peeing all night if you check that box?
   
Over the next 45 days, this task will teach you to be mindful of your priorities _throughout_ the day, not just at the beginning or end.
