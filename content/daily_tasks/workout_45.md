We're a gym, so it may not surprise you to find a fitness component in the challenge. ðŸ¤£ However, the challenge for the next 45 days is to workout _every day_. Let's break this down and see exactly what that means.

## Define "A Workout"

CrossFit counts. Not all of us work out every day of the week, and CrossFit does not cover all fitness goals and skills. For clarity, a workout is defined as:
>a practice or exercise to test or improve one's fitness for athletic competition, ability, or performance

This means things like skill development are in scope: actively working on push-ups, handstands, and recovery exercises. Yoga is a great active recovery exercise for non-gym days, as is Kelly Starrets's _The Ready State_ stretching program. A 45-minute walk will even count toward this goal and give you 45 minutes to listen to podcasts or audiobooks. Let's be clear though: walk with purpose. This is not a stroll to find a seat at the Sunday church service. It's the _"get to Golden Corral before the rest of these f**kers"_ walk at the end of the service.

## Why is this part of the challenge?

Time. Management.

Forty-five minutes can seem like a lot of time to set aside in your busy schedule. Making it a priority helps you de-prioritize tasks that don't add value to your life. Things like mindlessly surfing Facebook or Instagram, binge-watching Netflix or YouTube, or "pretending" to get ready to do other tasks. This will teach you to identify what is essential in your life, make the time to do it and leave unimportant tasks to remain forever undone.
