## Getting Started
The contents of this book are compiled from a 45-day challenge with a group of friends to evaluate, measure, and improve 
our lives (with a few bonus chapters that were excluded from the original 45-day challenge). Each chapter is designed to 
be a 1-day task, whether a physical challenge, a task to be completed, or a thought process to ponder.

Challenges like this work best when undertaken as a group. Find some friends and get after it. When motivation starts to 
wane, it is the responsibility of your group (or tribe, if you prefer) to call each other out on your bullshit excuses 
to complete the challenge.

You don't need anything to start. Just start.
