The contents of this book are compiled from a 45-day challenge with a group of friends to evaluate, measure, and improve our lives (with a few bonus chapters that were excluded from the original 45-day challenge). Each chapter is designed to be a 1-day task, whether a physical challenge, a task to be completed, or a thought process to ponder.

Challenges like this work best when undertaken as a group. Find some friends and get after it. When motivation starts to wane, it is the responsibility of your group (or tribe, if you prefer) to call each other out on your bullshit excuses to complete the challenge.
