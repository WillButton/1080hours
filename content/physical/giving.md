Today we are jumping the gun a bit and combining a physical component with being part of a community (which we'll discuss 
in more detail starting on day 36).

Are you as excited as I am? Probably not, but here we go anyway!

Inspired by [Cranksgiving](https://www.cranksgiving.org/), you and your fellow participants in this challenge are going 
to organize a race to collect items needed by a local charity. Here's how it works:

- Contact a local organization such as a food bank, homeless shelter, retreat, or church and ask what items they need donated
- This list is given to everyone participating
- Pick a date, time, and location for the event
- You can choose your mode of transportation: bikes, skateboards, roller blades, or the ol' shoe-leather express
- Race to see who can gather the items from the list the fastest *from the most locations*
- After everyone meets back at the starting point, decide on a winner (prizes are optional)
- Hang out, celebrate, reflect
- Donate everything collected to the chosen charity

This challenge carries multiple winning factors with it. First, it represents the need for real-world, functional fitness. 
Looking good in a mirror does you no good if you can't make tracks while transporting a turkey, baby! It also connects 
you with the needs of your community, as well as a solution for solving that need. Finally, it connects you with other 
people in your community in a way that brings you closer together and bonds you to a common cause. 

If you try this, be sure to let me know how it went!
