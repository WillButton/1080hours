Most laugh when I tell them to do this. _"That's crazy, bro. It's written by someone else after you die."_

Yeah. Most of the time it is, because the person who died didn't do it. But think about this: you just died and now you're 
pinning the responsibility of writing your own obituary on those currently struggling with losing you (hopefully)?

There's another reason to write your own obituary too: it's your last chance to leave everyone your final thoughts. It's 
an opportunity to tell those you love how much they meant to you.

It's one last chance for you to step up as a leader and tell them that it's going to be ok.

My obituary is in a sealed envelope in our home, to be opened if I die. I also have a digital copy on my laptop and a 
reminder each year to review it. Sometimes there are new things I'd like to say. Sometimes there are things that should be 
left unsaid. 

The final thing I'll say on it is this: it's for you, too. Sitting down to write it is a sobering experience. Were you 
the person you wanted to be? If not, what better time to find out than while you're still alive and can do something about it?
