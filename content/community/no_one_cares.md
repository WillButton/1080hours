How much weight did so-and-so put on the bar?

What's their PR?

Who Rx'd the WOD?

It doesn't matter.

Sometimes we're tempted to measure ourselves by others. This applies not only to our workouts but to other areas of our life as well. We define success by the achievements of others. While that's ok when looking to see what may be possible, it's important not to fall into the trap of thinking that others judge us by the same criteria.  Here's the magic secret:

No one cares.

Most people aren't even looking. They are focused only on their own efforts and battling their own demons. That's not to say everyone is self-absorbed. Sure, some people are, but that's not our problem. The problem is when we beat ourselves up over metrics that don't matter. It's almost impossible to judge yourself based on the accomplishments of others because we all start at different points.

If two people became millionaires, but one started with $999,999, it's not a fair comparison. When setting standards for yourself, use universal metrics: did you give it your all? Were your actions just and true? Was it better than yesterday, even by just 1%?
