All of us have a shared common interest in CrossFit. It's how we know each other and have found additional common bonds through that. Stepping back for a minute, though, why did we start doing CrossFit?

To get into shape. To improve our fitness.

So CrossFit is great for that, right? Sort of, but CrossFitâ€™s not responsible for the success.

The reason CrossFit works has absolutely _nothing_ to do with Murph, Fran, squat snatches, burpees, or Greg Glassman.

It's not about the workout.

You show up to class. We all do the same workout. We all suffer together. Suffering together forms bonds of friendship. So now, when you skip class, you feel guilty. Your friends are in the gym suffering, and you're not.

Guilt forces you to go to the gym.

Going to the gym leads to consistency.

Consistency leads to results.

We could be doing Jane Fonda workouts in the gym, and it wouldn't matter. The results would be the same.
